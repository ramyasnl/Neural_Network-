#Module 19 Challenge
## Overview of the analysis
Bek’s come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! </br>
Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.</br>

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.</br>

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. </br>Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:</br>

EIN and NAME—Identification columns</br>
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type</br>
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry</br>
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification</br>
USE_CASE—Use case for funding</br>
ORGANIZATION—Organization type</br>
STATUS—Active status</br>
INCOME_AMT—Income classification</br>
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application</br>
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested</br></br>
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively</br>

## What We Are Creating</br>
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report.</br> 
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model</br>
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model</br>
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model</br>
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Mode</br>
